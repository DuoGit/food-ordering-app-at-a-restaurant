# food-ordering-app-at-restaurant

## Description
A Java programming project to learn to create graphical user interfaces with *Swing* package.

## Context
At a local and small restaurant, each table is equipped with a touch screen for customers to order food from menu. In the kitchen of the restaurant, a cook reads an order of a customer from a screen and sends back the total estimated time it takes to serve. The timer starts counting down on both screens.
